# Calculator

## Description
This project processes text files containing math expressions, evaluates them, and outputs the results to a new file.

The user has 3 options available:
1. Enter a string – the program will calculate the result of the entered mathematical expression and output it to the command line.
2. Enter a file path – the program will calculate all mathematical expressions contained in the file and save the result in a new file in the same folder as the source file.
3. Enter both the source and result file paths – same as the second option, but the result file will be saved at the specified location.

Both file paths must be full, including the file extension.
